## Test Strategy
<br>
<br>

*The testing strategy defines the approach and methods for evaluating VSHOP – OPAS.*
<br>
<br>

**Approach**

* Manual Testing : All testing will be performed manually due to lack of automation setup and the need for deep system understanding.

* Black Box Testing: Main technique for verifying system behavior without inspecting internal code.

* Gray Box Testing: Applied where partial knowledge of system logic (data flows, database structure) is useful.

* Exploratory Testing: Conducted first to get to know the program, identify potential problem areas, and design detailed test cases.

* Positive and Negative Testing: All features will be tested with both valid and invalid inputs.

<br>

**What is Skipped**

* Unit Testing and Integration Testing are out of scope because we are evaluating an existing system, not developing it.

* Smoke Testing is not required since critical functionalities are already in active use.
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Test Design Techniques**

*To design test cases effectively, the following techniques will be applied*:

* Equivalence Class Partitioning

* Boundary Value Analysis

* State Transition Testing

* Pairwise Testing (mainly for compatibility testing)

* Error Guessing
