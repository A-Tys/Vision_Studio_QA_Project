## Risks and Assumptions
<br>
<br>

**Potential Risks**:
<br>

**1. Live System Constraints**

* The system is actively used by store employees. Testing may interfere with daily operations or require limited test data.
<br>

**2. Legacy Software Limitations**

* The system is out-of-date; some features may behave inconsistently or fail unexpectedly.

* Missing or incomplete documentation may make it difficult to fully understand certain modules.
<br>

**3. Environment Issues**

* Lack of a dedicated test environment may limit the ability to test without impacting real data.
<br>

**4. Data Quality**

* Existing production data may contain inconsistencies or errors, affecting test accuracy.
<br>

**5. Access and Permissions**

* Limited access to database, scripts, or administrative features may restrict testing scope.
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Assumptions**:

* All required software for testing is installed and operational.

* Testers have necessary credentials and access rights.

* The system will remain reasonably stable during the testing period.

* Critical functionalities are currently operational, smoke testing is not required.
