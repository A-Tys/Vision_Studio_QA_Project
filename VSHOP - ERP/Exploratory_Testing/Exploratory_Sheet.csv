General Observations / System-Wide Findings,,,,,,,
EXP_088,Tys,,,,,,"No API-based communication. The system does not provide an API for integration with external systems, and operates using server-side rendering. All data exchanges occur through standard web requests and responses."
EXP_089,Tys,,,,,,"The system HTML contains obsolete but conforming attributes (e.g. `border` on `<img>` elements, `background`on `<td>` elements, aligns on various elements, not with CSS, etc.). While these attributes are still supported by modern browsers, their usage is discouraged in favor of CSS-based styling."
EXP_090,Tys,,,,,,"The system uses JavaScript written according to older standards (ES5). E.g., usage of `var` for variable declarations, no import/export modules, no async/await syntax, etc."
EXP_091,Tys,,,,,,"The DOM is manipulated manually without using modern frameworks or libraries. The system JS code relies on direct DOM manipulation via standard methods like `getElementById`."
EXP_092,Tys,,,,,,"The system contains multiple pages that return HTTP 404 (Not Found) responses, and broken links which lead to dead-end navigation paths."
EXP_093,Tys,,,,,,"Under current test conditions, LCP values were consistently above 2.5 seconds on data-intensive pages (product catalogs, customer lists, and price list update screens). This indicates potential performance bottlenecks when handling large datasets."
