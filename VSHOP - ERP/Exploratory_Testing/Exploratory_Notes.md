## Exploratory Testing Notes
<br>
<br>

**Overview**
<br>
Exploratory testing will be conducted to evaluate the VSHOP – Online Portal Administration System (OPAS). Since no official requirements or user stories exist, *user stories will be inferred from real workflows and system modules*.  
<br>
These inferred user stories serve as a guide to explore the system, identify potential issues, and gather insights for future test scenarios and detailed test cases.
