## Exploratory Testing Report
<br>


## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the results of exploratory testing performed on the VSHOP ERP system.  
Exploratory testing was conducted to gain an understanding of the system’s current behavior, workflows, limitations, and risks in the absence of formal requirements documentation.

The findings documented in this report are based on exploratory testing sessions derived from inferred user workflows and real system usage.

## 3. Testing Approach

Exploratory testing was conducted using session-based testing techniques.

- Sessions were derived from inferred user stories based on real workflows.
- Testing focused on understanding system behavior rather than validation against predefined requirements.
- Observations were recorded during testing sessions and documented separately in exploratory notes and session sheets.
- No formal defect reporting was performed during exploratory testing.
